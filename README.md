# Carbon Footprint Tracker for Food Products

A full-stack web application that allows users (e.g., food producers or consumers) to track the carbon footprint of food products from production to consumption. This app will use data input from users (e.g., ingredients, production methods) and integrate with emission factor databases to calculate and display the carbon footprint of various food products.
